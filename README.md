This is a simple HTML/CSS project that demonstrates interactive box elements with stylish background images. The project showcases the use of CSS selectors and properties to create dynamic visual effects based on user interactions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of an HTML file and a corresponding CSS file. The HTML file defines the structure of the boxes, while the CSS file provides the styling and interactivity for the elements.

## Installation

To run the project locally, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git@github.com:ihsan606/qiscus-test.git
```
Then, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive boxes.

## Usage

The interactive boxes are designed to respond to user hover interactions.
